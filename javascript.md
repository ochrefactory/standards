# JavaScript Standards

Use the ES6 branch of the
[Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/es6)
as a starting point.

As ES6/ES2015 wonâ€™t get full browser support
for years to come,
use the [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) transpiler
to convert ES6 code down to ES5.

To get ES6 `import` functionality,
follow the lead of the Ember project,
and use [ES6 Module Transpiler](https://github.com/esnext/es6-module-transpiler).
