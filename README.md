# Standards

Coding and development standards adopted by our team.
To start off, follow these guidelines:

* Write readable code.
* Simplify code wherever possible.
  Max Kanat-Alexander said it well: “How Simple Do You Have to Be?
  […] Stupid, dumb simple.”
  (From [Code Simplicity](http://www.codesimplicity.com/book/))
* Be consistent.
* Don’t rewrite existing code to follow these standards,
  except as part of a small refactoring.
  Please don’t change the whitespace of an entire project
  when actively developing it with a team.
* If you need to violate a rule,
  make sure you are doing it to uphold readability and simplicity,
  or at least make sure you can convince a teammate.
