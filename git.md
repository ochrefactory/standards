# Git Standards

* Commit messages should
  follow the format outlined by tpope
  in [A Note About Git Commit Messages](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
* Use feature branches
  whenever you work on a feature
  of any significant size.
* Try to avoid breaking the master branch:
  master should always be deployable to production.
