# CSS

Here are the basics:

* use Sass, specifically, the SCSS syntax.
* use [BEM-like naming](http://cssguidelin.es/#bem-like-naming) for your selectors.
* avoid nesting whenever possible,
  and keep nesting levels minimal where unavoidable.
* use [concentric property ordering](http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2011/concentric-css/)
* build styleguides
* write the smallest amount of CSS necessary to get the job done.

## Resources

Our CSS guidelines are somewhat loose,
so meditate on these resources,
and get a better idea on the direction we want to go:

* Harry Roberts’ [Managing CSS Projects with ITCSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1OKZOV-iLj4&list=WL&index=3)
